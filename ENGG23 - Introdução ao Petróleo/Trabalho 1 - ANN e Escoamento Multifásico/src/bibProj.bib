abstract = {Pipelines daily transport and distribute huge amounts of oil and gas across the world. They are considered the safest method of transporting oil and gas because of their limited number of failures. However, pipelines are subject to deterioration and degradation. It is therefore important that pipelines be effectively monitored to optimize their operation and to reduce their failures to an acceptable safety limit. Numerous models have been developed recently to predict pipeline conditions. Nevertheless, most of these models have used corrosion features alone to assess the condition of pipelines. Hence, this paper presents the development of models that evaluate and predict the condition of offshore oil and gas pipelines based on several factors besides corrosion. The models were developed using artificial neural network (ANN) technique based on historical inspection data collected from three existing offshore oil and gas pipelines in Qatar. The models were able to successfully predict pipeline conditions with an average percent validity above 97% when applied to the validation data set. The models are expected to help pipeline operators to assess and predict the condition of existing oil and gas pipelines and hence prioritize the planning of their inspection and rehabilitation.}

abstract = {Abstract Neural networks are increasingly used to construct numerical solution methods for partial differential equations. In this expository review, we introduce and contrast three important recent approaches attractive in their simplicity and their suitability for high-dimensional problems: physics-informed neural networks, methods based on the Feynman–Kac formula and methods based on the solution of backward stochastic differential equations. The article is accompanied by a suite of expository software in the form of Jupyter notebooks in which each basic methodology is explained step by step, allowing for a quick assimilation and experimentation. An extensive bibliography summarizes the state of the art.},

abstract = {Flow pattern identification is critical for the flow assurance of the multiphase flow in the offshore oil & gas industry. For this purpose, an intelligent flow pattern identification model based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed in this study to identify different flow patterns of two-phase flow in the vertical section of subsea pipelines. The different vibration signals from four vibration sensors are converted by the continuous wavelet transform (CWT), and then fed into the improved LeNet networks, where the features in the last layer of the four LeNet are fused to develop the multi-input parallel convolutional neural network (CWT-Mul-LeNet). A series of two-phase flow pattern experiments for the vertical section of subsea pipelines are implemented in the multiphase flow loop to verify the performance of the proposed model. The results show that the accuracy of the proposed CWT-Mul-LeNet model is higher than that of CWT-LeNet (a single vibration sensor is allocated). Meanwhile, the performance of CWT is better than hilbert-huang transform (HHT) and short-time Fourier transform (STFT) in terms of time-frequency conversion. In addition, the identification accuracy of 99.06 % characterized by CWT-Mul-LeNet can be further improved by introducing the convolutional block attention module (CBAM) to 99.69 %, which is explained with the 3D t-SNE algorithm by means of feature visualization. The relevant data collected from the experiment can assist in the study of pipeline flow characteristics. The constructed model integrates information from complex positions, fully compensating for the shortcomings of traditional models with a single source of information data features, and improving the accuracy of intelligent flow pattern identification.}

abstract = {The Rate of Penetration (ROP) is a vital parameter in drilling operations. Due to the complex relationship between the parameters affecting ROP, accurate prediction of ROP is hard to be obtained analytically. In this study, a recurrent neural network model was developed to estimate ROP using Plastic Viscosity (PV), Mud Weight (MW), flow rate (Q), Yield Point (YP), Revolutions per Minute (RPM), Weight on Bit (WOB), nozzles total flow area (TFA), and Uniaxial Compressive Strength (UCS). The data were collected from more than 2000 wells drilled worldwide. The network architecture was optimized by trial and error. The data were categorized into three sets; 70 % for training, 15 % for validation, and 15% for testing. The created network predicted ROP with an average R2 of 0.94. With this tangible prediction method, oil and gas companies can better estimate the time of well delivery as well as optimizing ROP by altering the controllable input parameters affecting the ROP model. Artificial intelligent methods have shown their potential in solving complex problems. The oil and gas industry can benefit from artificial intelligence, especially with the large data sets available, to better optimize the drilling process.}
